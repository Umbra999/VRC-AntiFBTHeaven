Thanks to [XoX-Toxic](https://github.com/ToxicStuff) for the funny idea :*

This tool gets improved over time to fully eliminate the United Moderation tools. Normal players should not have the power to do such strong moderations in a lot of big worlds just because they dont like someone. United Moderation itself can not patch this tool up, if they get rid of the lists or replace them i will also replace them or put a alternate way in to fully block udon moderation.
