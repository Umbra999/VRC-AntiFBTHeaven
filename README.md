# VRC-AntiFBTHeaven
Prevents FBT Heaven Moderation System and allows you to use the Admin tools [NO EAC BYPASS NEEDED] This tool is ALLOWED by VRChat and you won't get banned for it

This is a simple tool thats blocking Azuki's FBT moderation lists, without the lists the Moderation system is losing its power and you are able to do the following

- Prevent FBT Heaven global Bans
- Prevent FBT Heaven global Mutes
- Prevent FBT Heaven instance Bans
- Prevent FBT Heaven instance Mutes
- Use Admin tools (Admin door for the roof etc..)

Requirements: NET 7.0 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0

Thanks to [XoX-Toxic](https://github.com/ToxicStuff) for the funny idea :*

This tool gets improved over time to fully eliminate the United Moderation tools. Normal players should not have the power to do such strong moderations in a lot of big worlds just because they dont like someone. United Moderation itself can not patch this tool up, if they get rid of the lists or replace them i will also replace them or put a alternate way in to fully block udon moderation.

For Azuki: Yo Azuki, you know automod is against TOS, you are not allowed to have a Ban and Mute list at all. You NEED to moderate on your own and only per instance. I reported you for this with proof so enjoy your Ban :)
